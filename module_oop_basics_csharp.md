## .NET Framework

- **What is .NET?**
    - **Answer:** .NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. It supports a variety of programming languages, including C#, F#, and Visual Basic. With .NET, developers can build web, mobile, desktop, gaming, and IoT applications.

- **Can you describe the difference between .NET Framework and .NET Core?**
    - **Answer:** .NET Framework is the original implementation of .NET that supports running websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows. .NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. Unlike the .NET Framework, .NET Core supports macOS and Linux in addition to Windows, and is designed to be modular and lightweight.

- **What project types do you know in Visual Studio/Rider?**
    - **Answer:** In Visual Studio and Rider, there are various project types including:
        - Console Application
        - Class Library
        - ASP.NET Web Application
        - ASP.NET Core Web Application
        - WPF Application
        - Windows Forms Application
        - Xamarin Mobile Application
        - Azure Functions
        - Blazor Application
        - Unit Test Project

- **What is a solution?**
    - **Answer:** A solution is a container in Visual Studio that organizes one or more related projects. Each project within a solution can produce an executable or a library, and solutions help manage the dependencies and build order between these projects. Solutions also store settings for how projects are built and debugged.

- **What is an assembly?**
    - **Answer:** An assembly is a compiled code library used by .NET applications for deployment, versioning, and security. It is the building block of .NET applications, containing code that the Common Language Runtime (CLR) executes. Assemblies can be either executable (.exe) or dynamic link libraries (.dll), and they contain one or more namespaces, types, and resources.

- **What is LINQ in .NET? How does it work?**
    - **Answer:** LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a feature in .NET that allows querying of data from different data sources (like collections, databases, XML, etc.) in a consistent manner using a syntax reminiscent of SQL. It works by providing a set of query operators that can be used to filter, project, sort, and group data in a type-safe way, integrated directly into C# and other .NET languages.

- **What are some commonly used LINQ methods that you know?**
    - **Answer:** Some commonly used LINQ methods include:
        - `Where` - Filters a sequence of values based on a predicate.
        - `Select` - Projects each element of a sequence into a new form.
        - `OrderBy` - Sorts the elements of a sequence in ascending order.
        - `OrderByDescending` - Sorts the elements of a sequence in descending order.
        - `GroupBy` - Groups elements that share a common attribute.
        - `Join` - Correlates elements from two sequences based on a key selector.

- **Which .NET class would you use if you need to generate random numbers? Explain its usage briefly.**
    - **Answer:** To generate random numbers in .NET, you would use the `Random` class. This class provides methods to generate random integers, doubles, and bytes. Here's a brief example of its usage:
      ```csharp
      Random random = new Random();
      int randomInt = random.Next();           // Generates a random integer
      int randomIntInRange = random.Next(1, 10); // Generates a random integer between 1 and 10
      double randomDouble = random.NextDouble(); // Generates a random double between 0.0 and 1.0
      ```
      The `Random` class is easy to use and allows for generating random values of different types with simple method calls.
- **Which .NET classes are used to read and write files in C#?**
    - **Answer:** The primary .NET classes used for reading and writing files in C# are:
        - `System.IO.File`: Provides static methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files, and helps in the creation of `FileStream` objects.
        - `System.IO.FileInfo`: Provides instance methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files.
        - `System.IO.StreamReader`: Implements a `TextReader` that reads characters from a byte stream in a particular encoding.
        - `System.IO.StreamWriter`: Implements a `TextWriter` for writing characters to a stream in a particular encoding.

- **Which .NET type is used for working with dates? Describe some of the functions related to this type.**
    - **Answer:** The `System.DateTime` type is used for working with dates and times in .NET. Some of its commonly used functions include:
        - `Now`: Gets the current date and time.
        - `Today`: Gets the current date with the time component set to 00:00:00.
        - `AddDays(double)`: Adds the specified number of days to the current `DateTime` instance.
        - `AddMonths(int)`: Adds the specified number of months to the current `DateTime` instance.
        - `AddYears(int)`: Adds the specified number of years to the current `DateTime` instance.
        - `ToString(string)`: Converts the value of the current `DateTime` object to its equivalent string representation using the specified format.

- **Which .NET class can be used for measuring time?**
    - **Answer:** The `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch` class is used for measuring time intervals in .NET. It provides methods to start, stop, and reset the timer, as well as properties to retrieve the elapsed time.
      ```csharp
      Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
      stopwatch.Start();
      // Code to measure
      stopwatch.Stop();
      TimeSpan elapsed = stopwatch.Elapsed;
      ```

- **What is NuGet?**
    - **Answer:** NuGet is a package manager for .NET. It enables developers to create, share, and consume useful code packages. It hosts a repository of over 100,000 packages that can be added to .NET projects to extend functionality, manage dependencies, and simplify the development process. NuGet packages are typically hosted on the public NuGet Gallery, but private repositories can also be used.

- **What is the `IEnumerable` interface?**
    - **Answer:** The `IEnumerable` interface is the base interface for all non-generic collections that can be enumerated. It defines a single method, `GetEnumerator()`, which returns an `IEnumerator` that allows iteration through the collection. Implementing `IEnumerable` enables objects to be used in foreach loops and LINQ queries.

- **What does the term _deferred execution_ mean? How does it relate to `IEnumerable` and LINQ?**
    - **Answer:** Deferred execution refers to the concept where the execution of an operation (such as querying data) is delayed until its results are actually needed. In the context of LINQ and `IEnumerable`, LINQ queries use deferred execution by default. This means that when you write a LINQ query, it doesn't execute immediately; instead, it creates an expression tree representing the query. Execution occurs when the results are enumerated (for example, in a foreach loop) or when certain terminal operations like `ToList()`, `Count()`, or `FirstOrDefault()` are called.

- **Describe some collection types you know.**
    - **Answer:** There are various collection types in .NET, including:
        - **Arrays (`T[]`)**: Fixed-size collections of elements of the same type.
        - **Lists (`List<T>`)**: Dynamic collections that can grow or shrink in size, implemented as arrays.
        - **Dictionaries (`Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`)**: Key-value pairs where each key is unique.
        - **Queues (`Queue<T>`)**: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) collections.
        - **Stacks (`Stack<T>`)**: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) collections.
        - **Sets (`HashSet<T>`)**: Unordered collections of unique elements.
        - **LinkedLists (`LinkedList<T>`)**: Doubly linked lists that allow efficient insertion and removal of elements at any position.

- **Why does the `System.String` type implement the `IEnumerable` interface? What are the advantages of this?**
    - **Answer:** `System.String` implements `IEnumerable<char>`, which allows iterating over each character in the string using a foreach loop or LINQ queries. This is advantageous because:
        - It provides a consistent way to process characters in a string, similar to how other collection types are handled.
        - It enables the use of LINQ methods like `Where`, `Select`, `FirstOrDefault`, etc., directly on strings for text processing tasks.
        - It simplifies algorithms that operate on strings by leveraging LINQ's expressive syntax and deferred execution capabilities.
        - It promotes code reuse and readability, as LINQ operations on strings can be written in a concise and expressive manner.


## Language features

- **What control statements are available in C#?**
    - **Answer:** C# provides several control statements to dictate the flow of execution in a program. These include:
        - **Conditional Statements:** `if`, `else`, `else if`, `switch`, and `case`.
        - **Looping Statements:** `for`, `foreach`, `while`, and `do-while`.
        - **Jump Statements:** `break`, `continue`, `return`, and `goto` (though `goto` is rarely used).
        - **Exception Handling:** `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw`.

- **What is the difference between a `for` loop and a `foreach` loop?**
    - **Answer:**
        - `for` loop: It is used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iterator. Example:
          ```csharp
          for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
          {
              // Code to execute repeatedly
          }
          ```
        - `foreach` loop: It is used to iterate over elements in a collection, such as arrays or objects that implement `IEnumerable`. It automatically iterates through each element without needing an explicit index or count. Example:
          ```csharp
          int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
          foreach (int number in numbers)
          {
              // Code to execute for each element in 'numbers'
          }
          ```

- **What is a `while` loop?**
    - **Answer:** A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before each iteration. Example:
      ```csharp
      int i = 0;
      while (i < 5)
      {
          Console.WriteLine(i);
          i++;
      }
      ```
      In this example, the loop prints values from 0 to 4 because the condition `i < 5` is true until `i` becomes 5.

- **What does the `yield` keyword do?**
    - **Answer:** In C#, the `yield` keyword is used in iterator methods to return each element one at a time to the caller. It enables you to create custom iterators without having to implement the entire enumerator manually. There are several forms of `yield`, such as `yield return`, which returns each element sequentially, and `yield break`, which terminates the iteration early. Example:
      ```csharp
      public IEnumerable<int> GetNumbers()
      {
          yield return 1;
          yield return 2;
          yield return 3;
      }
      ```
      In this example, calling `GetNumbers()` will return an enumerable sequence `{ 1, 2, 3 }` without the need to build a collection explicitly.

- **How do you manually break out of a loop?**
    - **Answer:** You can manually break out of a loop using the `break` statement. The `break` statement terminates the loop it is in and transfers control to the statement immediately following the loop.
      ```csharp
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      {
          if (i == 5)
          {
              break; // Exit the loop when i equals 5
          }
          Console.WriteLine(i);
      }
      ```
      In this example, the loop will print numbers from 0 to 4 and then exit when `i` equals 5 due to the `break` statement.

- **What does the `var` keyword mean?**
    - **Answer:** In C#, the `var` keyword is used to declare implicitly typed local variables. This means that the type of the variable is inferred by the compiler based on the initialization expression.
      ```csharp
      var name = "John"; // Compiler infers 'name' as string
      var age = 30;      // Compiler infers 'age' as int
      ```
      `var` is especially useful when the type of the variable is obvious from the initialization, improving readability without sacrificing type safety.

- **What is the _primary constructor syntax_?**
    - **Answer:** The primary constructor syntax in C# allows you to define a constructor directly within the parameter list of a class declaration. It simplifies the syntax for initializing properties of a class.
      ```csharp
      public class Person(string firstName, string lastName)
      {
          public string FirstName { get; } = firstName;
          public string LastName { get; } = lastName;
          
          // Other members...
      }
      ```
      In this example, `Person` class uses primary constructor syntax to initialize `FirstName` and `LastName` properties directly from constructor parameters.

- **What is the meaning of the `params` keyword? Where would you use it?**
    - **Answer:** The `params` keyword in C# allows you to specify a method parameter that takes a variable number of arguments. It must be applied to a single-dimensional array parameter of a method. You would use `params` when you want to pass an arbitrary number of arguments of the same type to a method without explicitly creating an array.
      ```csharp
      public int Sum(params int[] numbers)
      {
          int sum = 0;
          foreach (int number in numbers)
          {
              sum += number;
          }
          return sum;
      }
  
      // Usage
      int result = Sum(1, 2, 3); // Calls Sum with three integers
      ```
      In this example, `Sum` method uses `params int[] numbers` to accept a variable number of integer arguments, allowing flexibility in method calls.

- **What are _lambda expressions_? How are they used in C# development?**
    - **Answer:** Lambda expressions in C# are anonymous functions that allow you to define a method inline without having to explicitly define a separate method. They are typically used for writing concise and readable code, especially in LINQ queries and functional programming scenarios.
      ```csharp
      // Example 1: Lambda expression with parameters
      Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y) => x + y;
  
      // Example 2: Lambda expression in LINQ
      var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
      var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
      ```
      Lambda expressions are useful for passing methods as arguments to higher-order functions, implementing event handlers, and simplifying delegate instances.

- **What is the difference between a jagged array and a multidimensional array?**
    - **Answer:**
        - **Jagged Array:** A jagged array is an array whose elements are arrays. Each element can be of different sizes and dimensions. It is also known as an array of arrays.
          ```csharp
          int[][] jaggedArray = new int[3][];
          jaggedArray[0] = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
          jaggedArray[1] = new int[] { 4, 5 };
          jaggedArray[2] = new int[] { 6, 7, 8, 9 };
          ```
        - **Multidimensional Array:** A multidimensional array is a single array with multiple dimensions, often rectangular. It is declared using commas to separate each dimension size.
          ```csharp
          int[,] multiArray = new int[3, 2];
          multiArray[0, 0] = 1;
          multiArray[0, 1] = 2;
          // More assignments...
          ```
      The key difference is that jagged arrays can have varying lengths for each sub-array, whereas multidimensional arrays have fixed dimensions for all sub-arrays.

- **What is the difference between `const` and `readonly` fields in C#?**
    - **Answer:**
        - **`const` Fields:** `const` fields are compile-time constants. Their value is evaluated at compile time and cannot be changed afterwards. They are implicitly static and you cannot use a `const` keyword on a local variable.
          ```csharp
          public const int MaxValue = 100;
          ```
        - **`readonly` Fields:** `readonly` fields are similar to `const` fields in that they hold constant values that cannot be changed once initialized. However, their value can be assigned at runtime or in a constructor, allowing for more flexibility than `const`.
          ```csharp
          public readonly int MaxValue;
    
          public MyClass(int maxValue)
          {
              MaxValue = maxValue;
          }
          ```
      Use `const` when the value will not change and can be determined at compile time. Use `readonly` when the value may be determined at runtime or when initializing in a constructor.



## Type system

- **What are primitive types in C#? Give some examples.**
    - **Answer:** Primitive types in C# are predefined data types that are directly supported by the language and represent basic values. They are also known as built-in types or simple types. Some examples of primitive types in C# include:
        - `int`: Represents signed integers.
        - `float`: Represents single-precision floating point numbers.
        - `double`: Represents double-precision floating point numbers.
        - `bool`: Represents Boolean values (`true` or `false`).
        - `char`: Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character.
        - `decimal`: Represents decimal numbers with higher precision.
        - `byte`: Represents unsigned integers (0 to 255).

- **What is the difference between value types and reference types?**
    - **Answer:**
        - **Value Types:** Value types store their data in memory allocated on the stack. They directly contain their data and instances of value types are represented directly as their actual values. Examples include primitive types (`int`, `float`, etc.) and `structs` in C#. When you assign a value type variable to another, a copy of the value is made.
        - **Reference Types:** Reference types store references to their data in memory allocated on the heap. They do not store actual data but rather a reference (memory address) to where the data is stored. Examples include `class` instances, `arrays`, and `strings` in C#. When you assign a reference type variable to another, both variables refer to the same object in memory.

- **What is a class in C#?**
    - **Answer:** A class in C# is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the data (fields) and behaviors (methods, properties, events) that objects of the class will have. Classes are reference types and are fundamental to object-oriented programming in C#. They encapsulate data and functionality, providing a way to structure and organize code into reusable components.
      ```csharp
      public class Person
      {
          // Fields (data)
          public string Name;
          public int Age;
          
          // Constructor
          public Person(string name, int age)
          {
              Name = name;
              Age = age;
          }
          
          // Method
          public void SayHello()
          {
              Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name} and I am {Age} years old.");
          }
      }
      ```

- **What is a constructor?**
    - **Answer:** A constructor in C# is a special method of a class that is automatically called when an instance (object) of the class is created. It is used to initialize the object's state and allocate resources before the object is used. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type, not even `void`.
      ```csharp
      public class Person
      {
          public string Name;
          public int Age;
  
          // Constructor
          public Person(string name, int age)
          {
              Name = name;
              Age = age;
          }
      }
      
      // Creating an instance of the Person class
      Person person = new Person("John", 30);
      ```
      In this example, `Person(string name, int age)` is a constructor that initializes the `Name` and `Age` fields of the `Person` class when an object of `Person` is instantiated using `new Person("John", 30)`.


- **Is it possible to have multiple constructors in a class?**
    - **Answer:** Yes, it is possible to have multiple constructors in a class in C#. This is known as constructor overloading. Each constructor must have a unique signature (different parameters) to distinguish them. This allows for different ways to initialize objects of the same class depending on the parameters provided.
      ```csharp
      public class Person
      {
          public string Name;
          public int Age;
  
          // Constructor with parameters
          public Person(string name, int age)
          {
              Name = name;
              Age = age;
          }
  
          // Constructor without parameters (default constructor)
          public Person()
          {
              Name = "Unknown";
              Age = 0;
          }
      }
  
      // Usage
      Person person1 = new Person("John", 30); // Uses the first constructor
      Person person2 = new Person();          // Uses the second constructor
      ```

- **What are properties in C#?**
    - **Answer:** Properties in C# are members of a class that encapsulate private fields and provide a way to read or write their values. They expose a public "interface" to access and modify the state of an object while enforcing encapsulation and validation rules.

- **Describe the different types of properties: read-only, init-only, and computed properties.**
    - **Answer:**
        - **Read-only Properties:** Read-only properties have a getter but no setter. They can be initialized either directly in the property definition or in the constructor of the class, but once initialized, their value cannot be changed.
          ```csharp
          public class Person
          {
              public string Name { get; } = "Unknown"; // Initialized inline or in constructor
              public int Age { get; } = 0;
          }
          ```
        - **Init-only Properties (C# 9 and later):** Init-only properties are similar to read-only properties but can be initialized in constructors and during object initialization using the `init` accessor. Once initialized, their values cannot be changed.
          ```csharp
          public class Person
          {
              public string Name { get; init; } = "Unknown";
              public int Age { get; init; } = 0;
          }
          ```
        - **Computed Properties:** Computed properties do not store a value directly but calculate and return a value based on other data within the class or external factors.
          ```csharp
          public class Circle
          {
              public double Radius { get; set; }
    
              public double Area
              {
                  get { return Math.PI * Radius * Radius; }
              }
          }
          ```

- **What is the difference between an auto-property and a property with a backing field?**
    - **Answer:**
        - **Auto-Property:** An auto-property in C# is a shorthand syntax that automatically creates a private backing field for the property. It is declared with just a getter and setter without explicitly defining a separate field.
          ```csharp
          public class Person
          {
              public string Name { get; set; } // Auto-property with backing field created automatically
          }
          ```
        - **Property with Backing Field:** A property with a backing field explicitly declares a private field to store the property value. This allows more control over the property's behavior and enables additional logic in the getter and setter.
          ```csharp
          public class Person
          {
              private string _name; // Backing field
    
              public string Name
              {
                  get { return _name; }
                  set { _name = value; }
              }
          }
          ```
      Auto-properties are convenient for simple cases where no additional logic is needed in the getter and setter. Properties with backing fields offer flexibility for more complex scenarios requiring custom validation, lazy loading, or other operations.

- **What is an enum in C#?**
    - **Answer:** An enum (short for "enumeration") in C# is a value type that represents a set of named constants. It is used to define a collection of related constants that can be assigned to a variable. Enums provide readability and maintainability by allowing you to use descriptive names instead of numeric or string values.
      ```csharp
      public enum DaysOfWeek
      {
          Monday,
          Tuesday,
          Wednesday,
          Thursday,
          Friday,
          Saturday,
          Sunday
      }
  
      // Usage
      DaysOfWeek today = DaysOfWeek.Monday;
      ```
      In this example, `DaysOfWeek` defines a set of constants representing days of the week.

- **Explain the difference between a class and a struct.**
    - **Answer:**
        - **Class:** Classes in C# are reference types. They are allocated on the heap and are managed by the garbage collector. Classes support inheritance, can have constructors and destructors, and allow for the use of access modifiers to control access to their members.
          ```csharp
          public class Person
          {
              public string Name;
              public int Age;
          }
          ```
        - **Struct:** Structs in C# are value types. They are allocated on the stack or inline within containing types. Structs are typically used for small data structures that do not require inheritance. Structs do not support inheritance, cannot have destructors, and members are by default private.
          ```csharp
          public struct Point
          {
              public int X;
              public int Y;
          }
          ```
      Use classes for complex objects that require inheritance and reference semantics. Use structs for lightweight objects that represent a single value or small groups of related values.

- **Explain the difference between a class and a record.**
    - **Answer:**
        - **Class:** A class in C# is a reference type used to encapsulate data and behavior. It is typically used to model complex entities and support inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
        - **Record:** A record is a new reference type introduced in C# 9.0 designed specifically for immutability and data representation. Records are value-based and are often used for modeling immutable data structures.
          ```csharp
          public record Person(string Name, int Age);
          ```
      Records provide a concise syntax for declaring immutable objects and automatically generate value-based equality comparisons and a `ToString()` method.

- **What are interfaces? Why should we use them?**
    - **Answer:**
        - **Interfaces:** Interfaces in C# define a contract for classes to implement. They contain only method and property declarations without any implementation. Classes that implement an interface must provide concrete implementations for all interface members.
        - **Usage:** Interfaces allow for abstraction and decoupling in object-oriented design. They enable polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same type when they implement the same interface. Interfaces promote code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility by separating contract from implementation.
          ```csharp
          public interface ILogger
          {
              void Log(string message);
          }
    
          public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
          {
              public void Log(string message)
              {
                  Console.WriteLine(message);
              }
          }
          ```
      In this example, `ILogger` defines a contract for logging, and `ConsoleLogger` implements this contract to log messages to the console. Interfaces are essential for building modular and extensible software systems.
- **What is inheritance?**
    - **Answer:** Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the mechanism by which a class (called a subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors (methods, properties, fields) from another class (called a base class or parent class). It allows the subclass to reuse and extend the functionality of the base class.
      ```csharp
      public class Animal
      {
          public void Eat()
          {
              Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating.");
          }
      }
  
      public class Dog : Animal
      {
          public void Bark()
          {
              Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking.");
          }
      }
  
      // Usage
      Dog dog = new Dog();
      dog.Eat();  // Inherited from Animal
      dog.Bark(); // Defined in Dog
      ```

- **Is multiple inheritance allowed in C#?**
    - **Answer:** No, C# does not support multiple inheritance of classes. A class cannot directly inherit from more than one class. This was a design choice to avoid ambiguity and complexity in the language. However, a class can implement multiple interfaces, which is known as multiple interface inheritance.
      ```csharp
      public interface IA
      {
          void MethodA();
      }
  
      public interface IB
      {
          void MethodB();
      }
  
      public class MyClass : IA, IB
      {
          public void MethodA() { }
          public void MethodB() { }
      }
      ```

- **What is a static class?**
    - **Answer:** A static class in C# is a class that cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members (fields, methods, properties, events). It is typically used to provide utility functions or extension methods that do not require any state to be stored. Static classes are marked with the `static` keyword.
      ```csharp
      public static class MathHelper
      {
          public static int Add(int a, int b)
          {
              return a + b;
          }
      }
  
      // Usage
      int sum = MathHelper.Add(5, 3);
      ```

- **What are the dangers of using static classes? How can we avoid them?**
    - **Answer:**
        - **Dangers:** Static classes can lead to tight coupling and reduced testability if overused. They are inherently global and can introduce concurrency issues in multithreaded applications due to shared state. They also limit flexibility and extensibility compared to instance-based classes.
        - **Avoidance:** To mitigate these dangers:
            - Use static classes sparingly for utility methods that do not depend on or modify global state.
            - Consider using dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IoC) patterns to manage dependencies instead of static classes.
            - When using static members, ensure they are thread-safe, either by using thread synchronization techniques or by designing them to be immutable and stateless.

- **What are _extension methods_?**
    - **Answer:** Extension methods in C# allow you to add new methods to existing types (classes, structs, interfaces) without modifying their source code or inheriting from them. They are defined as static methods within a static class and are used as if they were instance methods of the extended type.
      ```csharp
      public static class StringExtensions
      {
          public static bool IsCapitalized(this string str)
          {
              if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(str))
                  return false;
              
              return char.IsUpper(str[0]);
          }
      }
  
      // Usage
      string text = "Hello";
      bool isCapitalized = text.IsCapitalized(); // Extension method call
      ```
      Extension methods are useful for adding functionality to types you don't control or for providing syntactic sugar for common operations.
- **What does the `virtual` keyword mean in C#?**
    - **Answer:** The `virtual` keyword in C# is used to modify a method, property, or indexer declaration and allow it to be overridden in derived classes. When a method is marked as `virtual`, derived classes can provide their own implementation of the method using the `override` keyword.
      ```csharp
      public class Shape
      {
          public virtual void Draw()
          {
              Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape.");
          }
      }
  
      public class Circle : Shape
      {
          public override void Draw()
          {
              Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle.");
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, `Draw()` in `Shape` is marked as `virtual`, allowing `Circle` to override it with its own implementation.

- **What is _overloading_ in C#?**
    - **Answer:** Overloading in C# refers to defining multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter lists (different number of parameters, different types of parameters, or different parameter order). Overloaded methods must have unique signatures.
      ```csharp
      public class Calculator
      {
          public int Add(int a, int b)
          {
              return a + b;
          }
  
          public double Add(double a, double b)
          {
              return a + b;
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, `Add()` is overloaded with two versions—one for `int` parameters and another for `double` parameters.

- **What are nullable value types?**
    - **Answer:** Nullable value types in C# allow value types (like `int`, `float`, `DateTime`, etc.) to have an additional state of `null` in addition to their normal range of values. This is achieved using the nullable type syntax `T?` where `T` is the underlying value type.
      ```csharp
      int? nullableInt = null;
      double? nullableDouble = 3.14;
      
      if (nullableInt.HasValue)
      {
          int value = nullableInt.Value; // Accessing the underlying value
      }
      ```
      Nullable value types are useful when you need to represent the absence of a value alongside valid values of the underlying type.

- **What is the `IDisposable` interface used for?**
    - **Answer:** The `IDisposable` interface in C# is used for releasing unmanaged resources such as file handles, database connections, and unmanaged memory allocated by an object. It defines a single method `Dispose()` that should be implemented to perform cleanup operations.
      ```csharp
      public class Resource : IDisposable
      {
          private bool _disposed = false;
  
          public void Dispose()
          {
              Dispose(true);
              GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
          }
  
          protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
          {
              if (!_disposed)
              {
                  if (disposing)
                  {
                      // Dispose managed resources
                  }
  
                  // Dispose unmanaged resources
                  _disposed = true;
              }
          }
  
          ~Resource()
          {
              Dispose(false);
          }
      }
      ```
      It is important to properly implement `IDisposable` to ensure resources are released promptly and to avoid resource leaks in your application.
- **What does the `using` keyword do? When would you use it?**
    - **Answer:**
        - The `using` keyword in C# is used in two distinct contexts:
            1. **Using Directive:** It is used to include a namespace in the current scope, allowing you to use types from that namespace without fully qualifying them.
               ```csharp
               using System; // Using directive to include the System namespace
               ```
            2. **Using Statement:** It defines a scope within which one or more resources (objects that implement `IDisposable`) are used and automatically disposed of when execution leaves the scope, either by completing normally or by throwing an exception.
               ```csharp
               using (var stream = new FileStream("file.txt", FileMode.Open))
               {
                   // Use the 'stream' object
               } // 'stream' is disposed here
               ```
        - You use the `using` statement primarily for handling disposable resources like files, database connections, or network connections to ensure they are properly cleaned up and resources are released.

- **What is the difference between a using block and a using statement?**
    - **Answer:**
        - **Using Block:** A using block is a syntactic structure that defines a scope within which a disposable object is instantiated and used. The object is disposed of automatically when the execution leaves the block, ensuring proper cleanup.
          ```csharp
          using (var resource = new SomeDisposableResource())
          {
              // Use 'resource'
          } // 'resource' is disposed here
          ```
        - **Using Statement:** A using statement, in its broader sense, includes both the using directive (for namespaces) and the using block (for disposable objects). The using block specifically refers to the construct that handles disposable objects.

- **How is it possible to use functions as objects in C#?**
    - **Answer:** In C#, functions can be treated as first-class citizens using delegates or lambda expressions:
        - **Delegates:** Delegates in C# are type-safe function pointers that define a method signature. They allow you to pass methods as parameters, store them in variables, and invoke them dynamically.
          ```csharp
          public delegate int Operation(int x, int y);
    
          public class Calculator
          {
              public int Add(int a, int b)
              {
                  return a + b;
              }
          }
    
          // Usage
          Calculator calc = new Calculator();
          Operation op = calc.Add;
          int result = op(3, 5); // Invoking 'Add' method through delegate
          ```
        - **Lambda Expressions:** Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent anonymous methods and can be used to create delegates or inline functions.
          ```csharp
          Func<int, int, int> multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
          int result = multiply(3, 4); // result = 12
          ```
      Functions as objects enable powerful patterns such as callbacks, event handling, and functional programming techniques in C#.

- **What is a `delegate`?**
    - **Answer:**
        - A delegate in C# is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. It is similar to a function pointer in C or C++. Delegates enable methods to be passed as parameters, stored in variables, and invoked dynamically.
        - Delegates are type-safe, allowing compile-time validation of method signatures. They are widely used for event handling, callback mechanisms, and implementing the observer pattern.

- **Describe the `Func<TResult>` delegate.**
    - **Answer:** The `Func<TResult>` delegate in C# represents a method that takes zero or more input parameters and returns a value of type `TResult`. It is a generic delegate defined in the `System` namespace and supports up to 16 input parameters (`Func<T1, T2, ..., TResult>`).
      ```csharp
      Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;
      int result = add(3, 5); // result = 8
      ```
        - `Func` delegates are often used for defining inline functions or passing functions as parameters to other methods. The last type parameter (`TResult`) specifies the return type of the delegate.

- **Describe the `Action` delegate.**
    - **Answer:** The `Action` delegate in C# represents a method that takes zero or more input parameters and does not return a value (void). Like `Func`, it is a generic delegate and supports up to 16 input parameters (`Action<T1, T2, ...>`).
      ```csharp
      Action<string> greet = (name) => Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}!");
      greet("John"); // Prints: Hello, John!
      ```
        - `Action` delegates are commonly used for defining and passing void methods or event handlers that do not return a value.

- **What does the `abstract` keyword mean in C#?**
    - **Answer:**
        - The `abstract` keyword in C# is used to declare abstract classes and abstract members (methods, properties, indexers, and events) within those classes. An abstract member does not provide an implementation and must be overridden in derived classes.
        - Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly; they serve as base classes for other classes to inherit from. They may contain abstract members that subclasses must implement.
      ```csharp
      public abstract class Shape
      {
          public abstract void Draw(); // Abstract method
      }
  
      public class Circle : Shape
      {
          public override void Draw()
          {
              Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle.");
          }
      }
      ```

- **What is an `abstract` class?**
    - **Answer:**
        - An abstract class in C# is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods or normal methods with implementations. It is marked with the `abstract` keyword.
        - Abstract classes serve as base classes for other classes to inherit from. They can define a common interface for a group of related classes while allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for abstract members.
        - Abstract classes can contain constructors, fields, properties, and other members like a normal class.
      ```csharp
      public abstract class Animal
      {
          public abstract void MakeSound(); // Abstract method
  
          public void Eat()
          {
              Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating.");
          }
      }
  
      public class Dog : Animal
      {
          public override void MakeSound()
          {
              Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
          }
      }
      ```
        - In this example, `Animal` is an abstract class with an abstract method `MakeSound()`, which `Dog` inherits and implements.
- **What is casting?**
    - **Answer:**
        - Casting in C# is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. It allows you to explicitly convert between compatible types, ensuring type safety and compatibility.
        - There are two types of casting:
            1. **Implicit Casting:** Automatically performed by the compiler when no data will be lost in the conversion, such as converting from `int` to `double`.
          ```csharp
          int num = 10;
          double result = num; // Implicit casting from int to double
          ```
            2. **Explicit Casting:** Requires explicit syntax and may involve potential data loss or risk of exception if the conversion is not valid, such as converting from `double` to `int`.
          ```csharp
          double num = 10.5;
          int result = (int)num; // Explicit casting from double to int
          ```

- **What is the difference between `is` and `as` operators in C#?**
    - **Answer:**
        - **`is` Operator:** The `is` operator checks if an object is compatible with a given type and returns `true` or `false`. It is used for type checking and type compatibility verification.
          ```csharp
          object obj = "Hello";
          if (obj is string)
          {
              string str = (string)obj;
              Console.WriteLine(str.Length); // Safe cast
          }
          ```
            - If the check (`obj is string`) succeeds, a subsequent cast `(string)obj` is guaranteed to succeed.

        - **`as` Operator:** The `as` operator attempts to cast an object to a specified type. If the cast succeeds, it returns the object as that type; otherwise, it returns `null`. It is used for safe type casting without throwing an exception.
          ```csharp
          object obj = "Hello";
          string str = obj as string;
          if (str != null)
          {
              Console.WriteLine(str.Length); // Safe cast
          }
          ```
            - The `as` operator is useful when you want to avoid exception handling and need to check for null after the cast.

        - **Key Differences:**
            - `is`: Checks if an object is compatible with a given type. Returns a boolean (`true` or `false`).
            - `as`: Attempts to cast an object to a specified type. Returns the object casted to the type if successful, otherwise returns `null`.

            - Use `is` when you need to check the type before performing an operation.
            - Use `as` when you want to cast and immediately use the casted object, checking for `null` if necessary.



## Architecture

- **Explain the Single Responsibility Principle.**
    - **Answer:**
        - The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a principle of object-oriented design that states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
        - This principle encourages developers to design classes that are cohesive and focused on a specific task or functionality. It helps in improving code maintainability, readability, and testability by reducing complexity and potential side effects.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          // Violation of SRP
          public class Employee
          {
              public void CalculateSalary() { /* Calculation logic */ }
              public void GeneratePaySlip() { /* Generation logic */ }
              public void SaveEmployeeData() { /* Persistence logic */ }
          }
    
          // Following SRP
          public class Employee
          {
              public void CalculateSalary() { /* Calculation logic */ }
          }
    
          public class PaySlipGenerator
          {
              public void GeneratePaySlip() { /* Generation logic */ }
          }
    
          public class EmployeeRepository
          {
              public void SaveEmployeeData() { /* Persistence logic */ }
          }
          ```
          In the example, the responsibilities (calculating salary, generating pay slip, and saving data) are separated into different classes, adhering to the SRP.

- **Explain the Interface Segregation Principle.**
    - **Answer:**
        - The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In other words, classes that implement interfaces should not be forced to implement methods they do not need.
        - This principle promotes the design of smaller, more specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose interfaces. It improves code readability, reduces the impact of changes, and ensures that classes are not burdened with unnecessary dependencies.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          // Violation of ISP
          public interface IWorker
          {
              void Work();
              void TakeBreak();
              void AttendMeeting();
          }
    
          public class Programmer : IWorker
          {
              public void Work() { /* Programmer-specific work */ }
              public void TakeBreak() { /* Common break logic */ }
              public void AttendMeeting() { /* Programmer attends meeting */ }
          }
    
          // Following ISP
          public interface IWorker
          {
              void Work();
          }
    
          public interface IBreakable
          {
              void TakeBreak();
          }
    
          public interface IMeetable
          {
              void AttendMeeting();
          }
    
          public class Programmer : IWorker, IBreakable, IMeetable
          {
              public void Work() { /* Programmer-specific work */ }
              public void TakeBreak() { /* Common break logic */ }
              public void AttendMeeting() { /* Programmer attends meeting */ }
          }
          ```
          In the example, `Programmer` now implements only the interfaces it needs, adhering to the ISP by segregating interfaces based on their use.

- **What is _composition over inheritance_?**
    - **Answer:**
        - Composition over inheritance is a design principle that suggests favoring object composition (building complex objects by combining simpler ones) over class inheritance to achieve code reuse and flexibility.
        - Instead of inheriting behavior from parent classes, objects are composed of other objects that encapsulate the required functionality. This approach typically results in loosely coupled designs, better encapsulation, and easier maintenance.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          // Using inheritance
          public class Animal
          {
              public void Eat() { /* Eating behavior */ }
              public void Sleep() { /* Sleeping behavior */ }
          }
    
          public class Dog : Animal
          {
              public void Bark() { /* Barking behavior */ }
          }
    
          // Using composition
          public class Animal
          {
              private readonly EatingBehavior _eatingBehavior;
              private readonly SleepingBehavior _sleepingBehavior;
    
              public Animal(EatingBehavior eatingBehavior, SleepingBehavior sleepingBehavior)
              {
                  _eatingBehavior = eatingBehavior;
                  _sleepingBehavior = sleepingBehavior;
              }
    
              public void Eat() { _eatingBehavior.Eat(); }
              public void Sleep() { _sleepingBehavior.Sleep(); }
          }
    
          public class Dog
          {
              private readonly Animal _animal;
    
              public Dog()
              {
                  _animal = new Animal(new DogEatingBehavior(), new DogSleepingBehavior());
              }
    
              public void Bark() { /* Barking behavior */ }
          }
          ```
          In the example, `Animal` uses composition to encapsulate behaviors (`EatingBehavior` and `SleepingBehavior`), and `Dog` utilizes `Animal` through composition rather than inheritance.

- **What is a model class?**
    - **Answer:**
        - In software development, a model class (often referred to as a domain model or entity) represents a real-world concept or entity. It encapsulates data and behavior related to the concept it represents, typically for use in an application's business logic or data manipulation.
        - Model classes often correspond to database tables in relational databases or document structures in NoSQL databases. They define properties (attributes) and methods (behavior) that describe and interact with the data.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          public class Product
          {
              public int Id { get; set; }
              public string Name { get; set; }
              public decimal Price { get; set; }
          }
    
          public class Customer
          {
              public int Id { get; set; }
              public string Name { get; set; }
              public string Email { get; set; }
          }
          ```
            - In this example, `Product` and `Customer` are model classes that encapsulate properties representing data related to products and customers respectively.

- **What is a service class?**
    - **Answer:**
        - A service class in software development typically refers to a class that encapsulates business logic or application-specific operations. It is often used to perform specific tasks that do not belong to entities or value objects directly.
        - Service classes help to keep business logic separate from presentation and data access layers, promoting better code organization, reusability, and testability.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          public interface IOrderService
          {
              void CreateOrder(Order order);
              void UpdateOrder(Order order);
              void DeleteOrder(int orderId);
              Order GetOrder(int orderId);
              IEnumerable<Order> GetOrders();
          }
    
          public class OrderService : IOrderService
          {
              private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;
    
              public OrderService(IOrderRepository orderRepository)
              {
                  _orderRepository = orderRepository;
              }
    
              public void CreateOrder(Order order)
              {
                  // Business logic for creating an order
                  _orderRepository.Create(order);
              }
    
              // Implement other methods of IOrderService
          }
          ```
          In this example, `OrderService` is a service class that implements `IOrderService` to perform operations related to orders.

- **Explain the Open/Closed principle.**
    - **Answer:**
        - The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.
        - This principle encourages developers to design systems that can be easily extended with new functionalities or behaviors without altering existing code, thereby reducing the risk of introducing bugs and maintaining stability.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          public abstract class Shape
          {
              public abstract double Area();
          }
    
          public class Circle : Shape
          {
              public double Radius { get; set; }
    
              public override double Area()
              {
                  return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
              }
          }
    
          public class Rectangle : Shape
          {
              public double Width { get; set; }
              public double Height { get; set; }
    
              public override double Area()
              {
                  return Width * Height;
              }
          }
          ```
            - In this example, `Shape` is an abstract class adhering to OCP by allowing new shapes (like `Circle` and `Rectangle`) to be added by extending the class without modifying existing `Shape` code.

- **Explain the Liskov Substitution Principle.**
    - **Answer:**
        - The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In essence, a subclass should be able to substitute its superclass without introducing unexpected behavior.
        - This principle ensures that inheritance hierarchies are well-designed and that subclasses adhere to the contract defined by the superclass, preserving the expected behavior of the system.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          public class Rectangle
          {
              public virtual int Width { get; set; }
              public virtual int Height { get; set; }
    
              public int Area()
              {
                  return Width * Height;
              }
          }
    
          public class Square : Rectangle
          {
              public override int Width
              {
                  get => base.Width;
                  set => base.Width = base.Height = value;
              }
    
              public override int Height
              {
                  get => base.Height;
                  set => base.Height = base.Width = value;
              }
          }
          ```
            - In this example, `Square` inherits from `Rectangle`, but adheres to LSP by overriding properties (`Width` and `Height`) to maintain the expected behavior of a square (where width equals height).

- **Explain the Dependency Inversion Principle.**
    - **Answer:**
        - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes). Furthermore, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
        - DIP promotes decoupling between modules/classes, improves code maintainability, flexibility, and facilitates easier unit testing and code reuse.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          public interface ILogger
          {
              void Log(string message);
          }
    
          public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
          {
              public void Log(string message)
              {
                  Console.WriteLine($"Logging to console: {message}");
              }
          }
    
          public class UserService
          {
              private readonly ILogger _logger;
    
              public UserService(ILogger logger)
              {
                  _logger = logger;
              }
    
              public void RegisterUser(string username, string email)
              {
                  // Business logic to register user
                  _logger.Log($"User registered: {username}, {email}");
              }
          }
          ```
            - In this example, `UserService` depends on `ILogger` abstraction (DIP) instead of a specific logging implementation (`ConsoleLogger`). This allows different logging implementations to be easily substituted without modifying `UserService`.


- **What do we mean by the Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns? Can you name some of these patterns?**
    - **Answer:**
        - The Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns refer to a set of 23 classical design patterns described in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. These patterns provide solutions to common design problems in software development and promote code reuse, flexibility, and maintainability.
        - Some of the GoF design patterns include:
            - Creational Patterns: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.
            - Structural Patterns: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.
            - Behavioral Patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor.

- **What are the risks associated with using the GoF design patterns?**
    - **Answer:**
        - While GoF design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems, there are several risks associated with their usage:
            1. **Over-engineering:** Applying patterns unnecessarily can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code, especially if the problem domain does not warrant such solutions.
            2. **Increased Complexity:** Some patterns introduce additional classes and indirection, which can make code harder to understand and debug.
            3. **Misapplication:** Choosing the wrong pattern or applying a pattern inappropriately can lead to code that is difficult to modify or extend.
            4. **Performance Overhead:** Certain patterns, such as Proxy or Decorator, may introduce performance overhead due to additional object creation or method invocations.
            5. **Learning Curve:** Understanding and implementing design patterns correctly requires knowledge and experience, which can be a challenge for developers new to patterns.
        - Therefore, it's essential to carefully evaluate whether applying a design pattern brings real benefits to the specific problem at hand, considering the trade-offs in terms of complexity and maintainability.

- **What do we mean by YAGNI?**
    - **Answer:**
        - YAGNI stands for "You Aren't Gonna Need It." It is a principle of Extreme Programming (XP) and Agile software development that discourages developers from adding functionality or design elements prematurely.
        - The principle suggests that developers should only implement features that are necessary for the current requirements and should not add speculative features or capabilities based on anticipated future needs.
        - YAGNI promotes simplicity, reduces unnecessary complexity, and focuses on delivering working software based on immediate requirements rather than hypothetical future requirements.
        - It encourages iterative development and allows software designs to evolve based on real feedback and changing requirements, rather than speculative or premature additions.

- **What do we mean by SLAP?**
    - **Answer:**
        - SLAP stands for "Single Level of Abstraction Principle." It is a software design principle that states that code within a function should not mix different levels of abstraction. Each function should operate at a single level of abstraction, focusing on a specific task or functionality.
        - This principle promotes code readability, maintainability, and understandability by ensuring that functions are cohesive and focused. It helps in reducing complexity and improving the clarity of code logic.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          // Example violating SLAP
          public void ProcessOrder(Order order)
          {
              ValidateOrder(order);
              CalculateOrderTotal(order);
              SaveOrderToDatabase(order);
          }
    
          // Example following SLAP
          public void ProcessOrder(Order order)
          {
              ValidateOrder(order);
              CalculateOrderTotal(order);
              PersistOrder(order);
          }
    
          private void PersistOrder(Order order)
          {
              SaveOrderToDatabase(order);
              SendConfirmationEmail(order);
          }
          ```
            - In the example violating SLAP, the `ProcessOrder` method mixes validation, calculation, and persistence logic. In contrast, the example following SLAP separates these concerns into distinct functions (`ValidateOrder`, `CalculateOrderTotal`, and `PersistOrder`).

- **What do we mean by KISS?**
    - **Answer:**
        - KISS stands for "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (or "Keep It Simple and Straightforward"). It is a principle of software design that advocates for simplicity in design and implementation.
        - The principle suggests that systems and designs should be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity or over-engineering. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          // Example violating KISS
          public void CalculateComplexAlgorithm(int[] data)
          {
              // Complex algorithm with multiple nested loops and conditions
          }
    
          // Example following KISS
          public void CalculateSimpleAverage(int[] data)
          {
              // Simple algorithm to calculate average
          }
          ```
            - In the example violating KISS, the `CalculateComplexAlgorithm` method is overly complex with nested loops and conditions. In contrast, the example following KISS simplifies the calculation to just computing an average.

- **What is the Repository Pattern?**
    - **Answer:**
        - The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that mediates between the domain/entity objects and data mapping layers (such as a database or file system). It provides a collection-like interface to access and manipulate data stored in a persistence mechanism.
        - The pattern encapsulates the logic required to access data sources, abstracting away the details of how data is fetched and stored. It helps in centralizing data access logic, promoting code reusability, and enhancing testability by allowing for easy mocking of data sources.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          public interface IRepository<T>
          {
              T GetById(int id);
              void Add(T entity);
              void Update(T entity);
              void Delete(T entity);
              IEnumerable<T> GetAll();
              // Additional methods as needed
          }
    
          public class CustomerRepository : IRepository<Customer>
          {
              private readonly DbContext _context;
    
              public CustomerRepository(DbContext context)
              {
                  _context = context;
              }
    
              public Customer GetById(int id)
              {
                  return _context.Customers.Find(id);
              }
    
              // Implement other methods of IRepository
          }
          ```
            - In this example, `CustomerRepository` implements `IRepository<Customer>` to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the `Customer` entity, abstracting away the details of database access.

- **What is a CRUD interface?**
    - **Answer:**
        - CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. A CRUD interface (or CRUD operations) refers to the basic set of operations that can be performed on data within a system or application.
        - It provides a standard way to interact with persistent data sources (such as databases) and is fundamental to database management systems and application development frameworks.
        - Example:
          ```csharp
          public interface ICrudRepository<T>
          {
              void Create(T entity);
              T Read(int id);
              void Update(T entity);
              void Delete(T entity);
              IEnumerable<T> GetAll();
              // Additional methods as needed
          }
          ```
            - In this example, `ICrudRepository<T>` defines the standard CRUD operations (`Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`, `GetAll`) that can be implemented by repositories to manage entities (`T`) in a system.



## Unit testing
- **Why is unit testing a good practice?**
    - **Answer:**
        - Unit testing is a good practice in software development for several reasons:
            1. **Early Bug Detection:** Unit tests help detect bugs early in the development process, allowing developers to fix issues before they propagate to higher levels of the application.
            2. **Improved Code Quality:** Writing tests forces developers to write modular, loosely coupled, and cohesive code, which enhances code quality and maintainability.
            3. **Refactoring Safety:** Tests provide a safety net when refactoring code. If tests pass after refactoring, it indicates that existing functionality is preserved.
            4. **Documentation:** Unit tests serve as documentation that demonstrates how the code is expected to be used and behave, especially useful in large teams or when revisiting code after some time.
            5. **Regression Prevention:** Tests guard against regressions by verifying that changes or new features do not break existing functionality.
            6. **Continuous Integration:** Unit tests are integral to Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines, ensuring that only working code is deployed to production.

- **What is NUnit?**
    - **Answer:**
        - NUnit is a popular open-source unit testing framework for .NET languages like C#. It is inspired by JUnit and provides a framework for defining and running tests. NUnit supports various features such as parameterized tests, setup/teardown fixtures, assertions, and test categorization.
        - Key features of NUnit include:
            - Attribute-based test definitions (`[Test]`, `[TestFixture]`).
            - Assert methods for verifying expected outcomes (`Assert.AreEqual`, `Assert.IsTrue`, etc.).
            - Parameterized tests to run the same test with different inputs.
            - Support for setup and teardown methods (`[SetUp]`, `[TearDown]`).
            - Integration with Visual Studio and other development environments.
        - Example of a simple NUnit test:
          ```csharp
          using NUnit.Framework;
    
          public class CalculatorTests
          {
              [Test]
              public void Add_TwoPositiveNumbers_ReturnsCorrectSum()
              {
                  // Arrange
                  Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    
                  // Act
                  int result = calculator.Add(3, 5);
    
                  // Assert
                  Assert.AreEqual(8, result);
              }
          }
          ```

- **What is a parameterized test?**
    - **Answer:**
        - A parameterized test (or data-driven test) is a type of unit test where the same test logic is executed multiple times with different input values. It allows testing a method or function with various inputs to verify that it behaves correctly under different scenarios.
        - Parameterized tests help reduce code duplication and enhance test coverage by testing a method with different edge cases, boundary values, or typical use cases.
        - NUnit and other testing frameworks support parameterized tests through attributes or methods that allow specifying data sources (arrays, collections, databases, etc.) from which test cases are generated.
        - Example of a parameterized test in NUnit:
          ```csharp
          using NUnit.Framework;
    
          public class CalculatorTests
          {
              [TestCase(3, 5, 8)]
              [TestCase(0, 0, 0)]
              [TestCase(-1, 1, 0)]
              public void Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsCorrectSum(int a, int b, int expectedSum)
              {
                  // Arrange
                  Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    
                  // Act
                  int result = calculator.Add(a, b);
    
                  // Assert
                  Assert.AreEqual(expectedSum, result);
              }
          }
          ```
            - In this example, the `Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsCorrectSum` test method is executed three times with different sets of input parameters (`a`, `b`, and `expectedSum`), validating the `Add` method of the `Calculator` class under various scenarios.

- **What options do you have in NUnit to create parameterized tests?**
    - **Answer:**
        - NUnit provides several options to create parameterized tests:
            1. **TestCase Attribute:** The `[TestCase]` attribute allows specifying individual sets of arguments directly within the test method attribute. It is suitable for simple parameterization scenarios.
               ```csharp
               [TestCase(2, 3, 5)]
               [TestCase(0, 0, 0)]
               [TestCase(-1, 1, 0)]
               public void Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsCorrectSum(int a, int b, int expectedSum)
               {
                   // Arrange
                   Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
      
                   // Act
                   int result = calculator.Add(a, b);
      
                   // Assert
                   Assert.AreEqual(expectedSum, result);
               }
               ```

            2. **TestCaseSource Attribute:** The `[TestCaseSource]` attribute allows referencing a property or method that returns arguments for parameterized tests. This is useful for scenarios where test data is generated or loaded dynamically.
               ```csharp
               private static readonly object[] TestData =
               {
                   new object[] { 2, 3, 5 },
                   new object[] { 0, 0, 0 },
                   new object[] { -1, 1, 0 }
               };
      
               [TestCaseSource(nameof(TestData))]
               public void Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsCorrectSum(int a, int b, int expectedSum)
               {
                   // Arrange
                   Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
      
                   // Act
                   int result = calculator.Add(a, b);
      
                   // Assert
                   Assert.AreEqual(expectedSum, result);
               }
               ```

            3. **ValueSource Attribute:** The `[ValueSource]` attribute allows specifying a property or method that returns a collection of values. NUnit generates a test case for each value in the collection, simplifying repetitive test cases.
               ```csharp
               [Test]
               [TestCaseSource(nameof(GetTestData))]
               public void Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsCorrectSum(int a, int b, int expectedSum)
               {
                   // Arrange
                   Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
      
                   // Act
                   int result = calculator.Add(a, b);
      
                   // Assert
                   Assert.AreEqual(expectedSum, result);
               }
      
               private static IEnumerable<object[]> GetTestData()
               {
                   yield return new object[] { 2, 3, 5 };
                   yield return new object[] { 0, 0, 0 };
                   yield return new object[] { -1, 1, 0 };
               }
               ```
        - These options in NUnit provide flexibility in defining parameterized tests based on different requirements and data sources.

- **What is _mocking_?**
    - **Answer:**
        - Mocking is a technique used in unit testing to create objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. Mock objects mimic the behavior of real objects but allow developers to define their responses to method calls, interactions, and expectations during testing.
        - Key aspects of mocking:
            - **Behavior Specification:** Developers can specify how mock objects should behave, what methods should return, and how they should interact with other objects.
            - **Isolation:** Mock objects isolate the unit under test from its dependencies, allowing developers to focus on testing specific functionality without invoking real external systems or components.
            - **Verification:** Mocking frameworks provide mechanisms to verify that certain methods were called with expected arguments or that expected interactions occurred during the test.
        - Mocking is commonly used in unit tests to replace complex or external dependencies (such as databases, web services, or file systems) with predictable behaviors, enabling controlled testing scenarios.

- **What is the difference between _mocking_, _stubbing_, and _faking_?**
    - **Answer:**
        - **Mocking:** Mocking involves creating objects that simulate the behavior of real objects, focusing on behavior verification and interaction testing. Mock objects are pre-programmed with expectations and responses to method calls during unit testing.
        - **Stubbing:** Stubbing is similar to mocking but typically involves providing simplified or pre-defined responses to method calls without focusing on behavior verification. Stubs are used to simulate specific scenarios or return values to facilitate testing.
        - **Faking:** Faking refers to replacing a real object with a simplified or alternative implementation that behaves similarly but is optimized for testing purposes. Fakes often provide a lightweight and predictable alternative to complex or external dependencies.
        - **Key Differences:**
            - **Purpose:** Mocking focuses on behavior verification and interaction testing. Stubbing and faking primarily focus on providing controlled responses or replacements for dependencies.
            - **Complexity:** Mocking frameworks often provide more advanced features for setting expectations, verifying interactions, and controlling object behavior compared to stubbing and faking.
            - **Usage:** Mocking is commonly used for detailed unit testing of complex interactions and dependencies. Stubbing and faking are used to simplify testing by replacing or isolating external dependencies with predictable alternatives.
        - While these terms overlap in their goals of facilitating unit testing, understanding their nuances can help in choosing the appropriate approach based on testing requirements and scenarios.



## Databases

- **What are relational databases? What are their advantages and disadvantages?**
    - **Answer:**
        - Relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores and organizes data in tables and establishes relationships between the tables using keys. Here are their advantages and disadvantages:

        - **Advantages:**
            1. **Structure:** Data is organized into structured tables, which simplifies data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
            2. **Relationships:** Relational databases support relationships between tables (primary keys, foreign keys), ensuring data integrity and enabling complex queries.
            3. **ACID Compliance:** They guarantee Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID properties), ensuring reliable transactions.
            4. **Standardization:** SQL (Structured Query Language) is widely adopted as the standard query language for relational databases, promoting compatibility and ease of use.
            5. **Scalability:** Relational databases can scale vertically (increasing hardware resources) and horizontally (using clustering or sharding) to handle large volumes of data.

        - **Disadvantages:**
            1. **Complexity:** Designing relational databases with normalized schemas and relationships requires careful planning and understanding of database concepts.
            2. **Performance:** Complex queries involving multiple joins can impact performance, especially with large datasets.
            3. **Schema Modifications:** Changing the database schema (table structures) can be complex and may require downtime for maintenance.
            4. **Scalability Limits:** Scaling relational databases horizontally can be challenging compared to NoSQL databases designed for distributed architectures.
            5. **Cost:** Commercial relational databases may involve licensing fees, especially for enterprise-level deployments.

- **How do you associate entities to each other in a relational database model?**
    - **Answer:**
        - Entities are associated with each other in a relational database model through relationships. The primary mechanisms for establishing relationships are:
            1. **Primary Key - Foreign Key Relationship:** This is the most common method where a column (or set of columns) in one table references the primary key of another table.
            2. **One-to-One Relationship:** Each row in one table is related to exactly one row in another table.
            3. **One-to-Many Relationship:** Each row in one table can be related to multiple rows in another table.
            4. **Many-to-Many Relationship:** Multiple rows in one table are related to multiple rows in another table through an intermediate table.
        - Relationships are defined using SQL constraints, such as FOREIGN KEY constraints, which enforce referential integrity between tables.

- **What are tables in a relational database?**
    - **Answer:**
        - In a relational database, a table is a collection of related data organized in rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). Each row represents a unique record, and each column represents a specific attribute or field of that record.
        - Tables are defined with a fixed schema that specifies the columns, data types, and constraints (such as primary keys, foreign keys) that govern the structure and integrity of the data.
        - Example of a simple table definition:
          ```sql
          CREATE TABLE Employees (
              EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
              FirstName VARCHAR(50),
              LastName VARCHAR(50),
              DepartmentID INT,
              FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
          );
          ```

- **What is a _primary key_?**
    - **Answer:**
        - A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a relational database table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It ensures that no two rows can have the same key value.
        - Characteristics of a primary key:
            1. **Uniqueness:** Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique within the table.
            2. **Non-null:** The primary key column(s) cannot contain NULL values.
            3. **Indexed:** By default, primary keys are indexed to enforce fast data retrieval and uniqueness.
        - Example:
          ```sql
          CREATE TABLE Departments (
              DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
              DepartmentName VARCHAR(100)
          );
          ```
            - In this example, `DepartmentID` is the primary key of the `Departments` table, ensuring each department has a unique identifier.
- **What is a _foreign key_?**
    - **Answer:**
        - A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a relational database table that establishes a link between data in two tables. It enforces referential integrity between the tables by ensuring that the values in the foreign key column(s) match values in the primary key column(s) of another table.
        - Key points about foreign keys:
            1. **Relationship:** It defines a relationship between the referencing (child) table and the referenced (parent) table.
            2. **Referential Integrity:** Foreign keys maintain referential integrity by preventing actions that would violate relationships, such as deleting a parent record that has dependent child records.
            3. **Constraints:** Typically, foreign keys are defined using SQL constraints, such as FOREIGN KEY constraints, which specify the relationship between tables.
        - Example:
          ```sql
          CREATE TABLE Orders (
              OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
              CustomerID INT,
              OrderDate DATE,
              FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
          );
          ```
            - In this example, `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table is a foreign key that references the `CustomerID` primary key column in the `Customers` table, establishing a relationship between orders and customers.

- **What does the SQL abbreviation stand for?**
    - **Answer:**
        - SQL stands for "Structured Query Language." It is a standardized programming language designed for managing relational databases and performing various operations on data.
        - SQL provides commands for querying data (SELECT), manipulating data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), defining and modifying schema (CREATE, ALTER, DROP), and controlling access to data (GRANT, REVOKE).
        - The SQL language is widely adopted and serves as the standard for relational database management systems (RDBMS), enabling developers to interact with and manage data efficiently.

- **What are some of the SQL database providers that you’ve heard of?**
    - **Answer:**
        - SQL database providers refer to vendors or products that offer relational database management systems (RDBMS) implementing SQL standards. Some well-known SQL database providers include:
            1. **Microsoft SQL Server:** Developed by Microsoft, SQL Server is a robust RDBMS supporting SQL and T-SQL (Transact-SQL) for enterprise-level applications.
            2. **MySQL:** MySQL is an open-source RDBMS developed by Oracle Corporation. It is widely used for web applications and supports SQL.
            3. **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is an open-source RDBMS known for its advanced features, extensibility, and support for SQL standards. It is suitable for a wide range of applications.
            4. **Oracle Database:** Oracle Database is a commercial RDBMS developed by Oracle Corporation. It supports SQL and PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL) and is commonly used in large enterprises.
            5. **SQLite:** SQLite is a lightweight, embedded RDBMS designed for simplicity and minimal configuration. It is often used in mobile apps, embedded systems, and small-scale applications.
            6. **MariaDB:** MariaDB is a community-developed fork of MySQL, designed to be compatible with MySQL and offering additional features and enhancements.
            7. **IBM Db2:** IBM Db2 is a family of data management products providing SQL-based relational database capabilities for enterprise environments.
        - These SQL database providers offer different features, scalability options, and licensing models to meet various application and business needs.
- **What are SQL data types? Are there any differences in data types between different SQL databases?**
    - **Answer:**
        - SQL data types define the type of data that can be stored in a column of a table within a relational database. Each SQL database system provides a set of built-in data types, which can be categorized into several groups:
            1. **Numeric Types:** Integers (`INT`, `SMALLINT`, `BIGINT`), floating-point numbers (`FLOAT`, `REAL`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`), decimal numbers (`DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC`).
            2. **Character Strings:** Fixed-length strings (`CHAR`), variable-length strings (`VARCHAR`, `NVARCHAR`), large text objects (`TEXT`, `NTEXT`).
            3. **Date and Time Types:** Date (`DATE`), time (`TIME`), timestamp (`DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`), interval.
            4. **Boolean Type:** Boolean (`BOOLEAN`).
            5. **Binary Large Objects:** Binary data (`BLOB`, `BYTEA`).
            6. **Other Types:** XML (`XML`), JSON (`JSON`), spatial types (geometric shapes, geographical coordinates).

        - **Differences Between SQL Databases:**
            - While many SQL databases adhere to ANSI SQL standards for basic data types, there can be variations and additional types specific to each database system.
            - For example, SQL Server has specific types like `DATETIME2`, `SMALLDATETIME`, and `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER`, which may not be present in MySQL or PostgreSQL.
            - Additionally, some databases may have different size limits or behavior for certain data types, such as string length limits or precision differences in numeric types.

- **What are _constraints_ in SQL?**
    - **Answer:**
        - Constraints in SQL are rules or conditions applied to columns or tables to enforce data integrity and maintain consistency in the database. Constraints define limits and relationships that data must adhere to, ensuring valid and accurate data storage. Common SQL constraints include:
            1. **Primary Key Constraint:** Ensures each row in a table is uniquely identified. (`PRIMARY KEY`)
            2. **Foreign Key Constraint:** Establishes a relationship between two tables by enforcing referential integrity. (`FOREIGN KEY`)
            3. **Unique Constraint:** Ensures that all values in a column (or a set of columns) are unique. (`UNIQUE`)
            4. **Check Constraint:** Defines a condition that must be true for each row in a table. (`CHECK`)
            5. **Not Null Constraint:** Ensures that a column cannot have a `NULL` value. (`NOT NULL`)
        - Constraints are specified when creating tables or altering table structures using SQL commands. They help prevent invalid data entry, maintain data integrity, and enforce business rules within the database.

- **How can we program different SQL databases in C#?**
    - **Answer:**
        - Programming with different SQL databases in C# involves using database-specific libraries or frameworks to interact with the database from C# code. Commonly used methods include:
            1. **ADO.NET:** The foundational library in .NET for data access is ADO.NET. It provides classes like `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, `SqlDataAdapter`, etc., for executing SQL commands and retrieving data from SQL databases.
                - Example using ADO.NET with SQL Server:
                  ```csharp
                  using System;
                  using System.Data.SqlClient;
       
                  class Program
                  {
                      static void Main()
                      {
                          string connectionString = "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;";
                          using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
                          {
                              connection.Open();
                              string sql = "SELECT * FROM Customers";
                              using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection))
                              {
                                  SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();
                                  while (reader.Read())
                                  {
                                      Console.WriteLine($"{reader["CustomerID"]}, {reader["CompanyName"]}");
                                  }
                                  reader.Close();
                              }
                          }
                      }
                  }
                  ```

            2. **Entity Framework (EF):** EF is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies data access in .NET applications. It abstracts the database interaction with higher-level object-oriented concepts, using LINQ (Language Integrated Query) for queries.
                - Example using Entity Framework Core with SQL Server:
                  ```csharp
                  using System;
                  using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
       
                  public class MyDbContext : DbContext
                  {
                      public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
       
                      protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
                      {
                          optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;");
                      }
                  }
       
                  class Program
                  {
                      static void Main()
                      {
                          using (var context = new MyDbContext())
                          {
                              var customers = context.Customers.ToList();
                              foreach (var customer in customers)
                              {
                                  Console.WriteLine($"{customer.CustomerID}, {customer.CompanyName}");
                              }
                          }
                      }
                  }
                  ```
            - By using ADO.NET directly or ORM frameworks like Entity Framework, developers can write C# code that interacts with various SQL databases (such as SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL) while abstracting database-specific details and leveraging .NET features for efficient data access and manipulation.

- **Which SQL statement is used to create tables? Describe the syntax briefly.**
    - **Answer:**
        - The SQL statement used to create tables is `CREATE TABLE`. It is used to define and create a new table in the database. Here's a brief syntax overview:
          ```sql
          CREATE TABLE table_name (
              column1 datatype constraints,
              column2 datatype constraints,
              ...
              columnN datatype constraints
          );
          ```
            - **Example:**
              ```sql
              CREATE TABLE Employees (
                  EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
                  FirstName VARCHAR(50),
                  LastName VARCHAR(50),
                  HireDate DATE,
                  Salary DECIMAL(10,2)
              );
              ```
            - In this example:
                - `CREATE TABLE` indicates the start of the statement to create a new table named `Employees`.
                - Columns (`EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `HireDate`, `Salary`) are defined with their data types (`INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, `DECIMAL`) and optional constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`).

- **Which SQL statement can be used to insert values? Describe the syntax briefly.**
    - **Answer:**
        - The SQL statement used to insert values into a table is `INSERT INTO`. It adds new rows of data into an existing table. Here's a brief syntax overview:
          ```sql
          INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
          VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN);
          ```
            - **Example:**
              ```sql
              INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate, Salary)
              VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '2024-07-17', 50000.00);
              ```
            - In this example:
                - `INSERT INTO` specifies the table (`Employees`) where data will be inserted.
                - Columns (`EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `HireDate`, `Salary`) are listed, followed by `VALUES` containing corresponding data for each column.

- **Which SQL statement can be used to update values? Describe the syntax briefly.**
    - **Answer:**
        - The SQL statement used to update values in a table is `UPDATE`. It modifies existing data in one or more rows within a table based on specified conditions. Here's a brief syntax overview:
          ```sql
          UPDATE table_name
          SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ..., columnN = valueN
          WHERE condition;
          ```
            - **Example:**
              ```sql
              UPDATE Employees
              SET Salary = 55000.00
              WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
              ```
            - In this example:
                - `UPDATE` specifies the table (`Employees`) to update.
                - `SET` assigns new values (`Salary = 55000.00`) to specified columns (`Salary`).
                - `WHERE` specifies the condition (`EmployeeID = 1`) to identify which rows to update based on criteria.

- **Which SQL statement can be used to delete rows? Describe the syntax briefly.**
    - **Answer:**
        - The SQL statement used to delete rows from a table is `DELETE FROM`. It removes one or more rows based on specified conditions. Here's a brief syntax overview:
          ```sql
          DELETE FROM table_name
          WHERE condition;
          ```
            - **Example:**
              ```sql
              DELETE FROM Employees
              WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
              ```
            - In this example:
                - `DELETE FROM` specifies the table (`Employees`) from which to delete rows.
                - `WHERE` specifies the condition (`EmployeeID = 1`) to identify which rows to delete based on criteria.

- **Which SQL statement can be used to create queries? Describe the syntax briefly.**
    - **Answer:**
        - The SQL statement used to create queries (retrieve data) from one or more tables is `SELECT`. It fetches data based on specified criteria and conditions. Here's a brief syntax overview:
          ```sql
          SELECT column1, column2, ...
          FROM table_name
          WHERE condition
          ORDER BY column1 ASC|DESC;
          ```
            - **Example:**
              ```sql
              SELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate
              FROM Employees
              WHERE DepartmentID = 1
              ORDER BY HireDate DESC;
              ```
            - In this example:
                - `SELECT` specifies the columns (`FirstName`, `LastName`, `HireDate`) to retrieve from the table (`Employees`).
                - `FROM` specifies the table (`Employees`) from which to retrieve data.
                - `WHERE` optionally filters rows based on conditions (`DepartmentID = 1`).
                - `ORDER BY` sorts the result set by `HireDate` in descending order (`DESC`).

- **How can you join tables together in SQL? When should you do it?**
    - **Answer:**
        - Tables can be joined together in SQL using different types of joins (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`) to combine related data from multiple tables based on common columns. You should join tables when you need to retrieve data that spans multiple entities related by keys (foreign and primary) to avoid data redundancy and ensure data integrity.
        - **Syntax for INNER JOIN:**
          ```sql
          SELECT columns
          FROM table1
          INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
          ```
            - **Example:**
              ```sql
              SELECT Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
              FROM Employees
              INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
              ```
            - In this example:
                - `INNER JOIN` combines rows from `Employees` and `Departments` where `DepartmentID` matches in both tables.
        - **When to use joins:**
            - **Data Normalization:** When database design follows normalization principles, related data is split into multiple tables. Joins are necessary to recombine data for querying.
            - **Complex Queries:** For complex queries involving data aggregation, filtering, and retrieval across multiple tables.
            - **Efficiency:** To minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity by referencing related data through foreign keys.
